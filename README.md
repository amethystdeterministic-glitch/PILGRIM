# PILGRIM

PILGRIM is a deterministic execution framework for verifiable, reproducible computation in high-stakes systems.

It is designed for environments where **“probably correct” is not acceptable** — including research, regulation, finance, and safety-critical domains.

This repository currently contains architecture, specifications, and reference materials for PILGRIM v1.
